# Why it was interesting
Java is one of my favorite languages as I found it to align to my way of thinking when I code, making it an enjoyable experience when building programs. This article stood out to me mainly because it discusses how AI and Java are compatible, and how Spring AI and Java will become more integrated with each other in the future. This made me wonder why even code at all? If the AI's so great, let's all leave our jobs and go on a vacation in Honolulu. I think there's beauty in seeing beginner programmers making horrendous nested if-statmentsâ€” it gives the code a nice human touch in an inanimate mechanistic environment.
